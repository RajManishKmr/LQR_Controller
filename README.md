# Attitude control of Aircraft using LQR controller
# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an Attitude Control System for Aircraft using an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller. The project was developed using MATLAB and Simulink, aiming to achieve precise control over the aircraft's attitude for enhanced stability and performance.
# Features
Utilized LQR control technique to design a state-feedback controller for aircraft attitude control.
Simulated the control system in Simulink to analyze the response under various scenarios.
Incorporated wind disturbance modeling to assess the control system's performance under real-world conditions.
Evaluated the controller's ability to maintain stable aircraft attitude in the presence of varying wind speeds and directions.
Included in this repository visualization of control inputs, attitude angles, response plots and final report of project.

# Usage
Open the Simulink model to explore the control system setup.
Adjust parameters such as control gains, initial conditions, disturbances (including wind), to observe their effects on the system response.
Run the simulation and analyze the results, particularly focusing on how the control system responds to wind disturbances.
# Results
The simulation results showcase the effectiveness of the LQR controller in maintaining stable aircraft attitude even in the presence of wind disturbances.
By incorporating the wind disturbance aspect, you demonstrate a more realistic and practical assessment of your control system's performance.
